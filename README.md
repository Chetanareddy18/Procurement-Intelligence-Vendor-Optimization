Procurement Intelligence: Vendor Optimization
Efficiency • Reliability • Growth
Project Overview

This repository presents a data-driven procurement and vendor performance analysis conducted for W. Gr Inc., a vendor operating across multiple locations. The study, titled “To Buy or Not to Buy”, evaluates procurement effectiveness using Power BI dashboards and focuses on identifying operational gaps, satisfaction drivers, and growth opportunities.

The analysis is based on a 12-month dataset covering procurement cycles, payments, freight costs, vendor performance, and product sales. Insights derived from this study support informed decision-making aimed at improving efficiency, reliability, and long-term scalability.

Objectives

The project is structured around three strategic objectives:

Improve Client Satisfaction
Identify operational and cost-related factors that influence customer experience and vendor trust.

Enhance Operational Efficiency
Analyze procurement cycles, lead times, and process bottlenecks to reduce delays and improve consistency.

Foster Innovation in Product Offerings
Assess product concentration and category diversity to identify opportunities for new, high-impact product introductions.

Executive Summary

The Power BI dashboards reveal that performance challenges at W. Gr Inc. are primarily driven by delayed payments, extended procurement cycles, and over-dependence on a single product classification.

Key findings include:

Average response time of 16.46 days

Only 17.91% of payments completed on time

Procurement cycle averaging 52.15 days

Nearly 65% of total revenue concentrated in one product classification

The analysis indicates that by streamlining payment processes, strengthening vendor accountability, optimizing freight costs, and expanding the product portfolio, W. Gr Inc. can realistically achieve:

A 30% improvement in client satisfaction

A 25% reduction in procurement cycle time

The successful launch of 2–3 new high-volume products

Dashboard Insights
Objective 1: Client Satisfaction

This dashboard evaluates customer experience using operational proxies such as response time, payment timeliness, freight cost, and vendor reliability.

Long response times and late payments significantly reduce perceived reliability.

Freight cost spikes correlate with drops in experience scores.

A small group of vendors contributes disproportionately to dissatisfaction.

Improving payment timeliness and addressing high-cost vendors emerge as the most effective levers for raising satisfaction levels.

Objective 2: Operational Efficiency

This dashboard focuses on procurement cycle performance and vendor-level variability.

Average procurement cycle time stands at 52.15 days.

While SLA compliance is high (89.33%), payment delays remain the dominant bottleneck.

Vendor cycle times range widely from 40 to 62 days, creating inconsistency.

Automation of approvals and tighter enforcement of vendor timelines present clear opportunities to reduce cycle time by 20–25%.

Objective 3: Innovation in Product Offerings

This dashboard examines revenue distribution and product diversity.

Category diversity is moderate at 45.17%.

A single classification accounts for over 65% of revenue, indicating concentration risk.

Sales are distributed across many products, suggesting potential for scalable new launches.

The findings support the introduction of 2–3 new products in underrepresented categories to strengthen growth and reduce dependence on a single segment.

Implementation Approach

To address the identified gaps, the following actions are recommended:

Automate payment approval workflows to eliminate delays.

Enforce stricter vendor SLAs to normalize procurement timelines.

Renegotiate freight agreements with high-cost vendors.

Pilot new products in underutilized categories and scale based on performance.

Use Power BI dashboards as continuous monitoring tools for key performance indicators.

Forecast and Expected Impact

Reduction of procurement cycle time by approximately 13 days within one year.

Increase in on-time payment rate from 17.91% to over 80%.

Improvement in client satisfaction by around 30%.

Reduced revenue concentration and improved resilience to market changes.
Conclusion

This project demonstrates how procurement and vendor data can be transformed into actionable insights through effective visualization and analysis. By focusing on payment discipline, vendor reliability, and product diversification, organizations can improve operational performance, enhance customer satisfaction, and support sustainable growth.
